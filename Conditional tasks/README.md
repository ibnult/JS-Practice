# JavaScript Conditional Logic Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript programs designed to practice and demonstrate conditional logic using `if-else`, `nested if-else`, and the ternary operator.

## 1. Free Drinks

A simple program that checks the burger price and offers a free Coke if the price exceeds 500 Taka.

**Conditions:**
- If burger price > 500 Taka: Free Coke
- Else: Coke costs 30 Taka

## 2. BMI Calculator and Health Category

This program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and assigns a health category based on the result using nested `if-else` statements.

**Formula:**  
`BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2`

**Health Categories:**
- BMI < 18.5: Underweight
- 18.5 ≤ BMI ≤ 24.9: Normal
- 25 ≤ BMI ≤ 29.9: Overweight
- BMI ≥ 30: Obese

## 3. Grade Calculator

This program accepts a student's score and returns the corresponding grade using simple `if-else-if` conditions.

**Grading Scale:**
- A: 90 - 100
- B: 80 - 89
- C: 70 - 79
- D: 60 - 69
- F: 0 - 59

## 4. Friend Score Reaction

This program evaluates your score and your friend’s score using nested `if-else-if-else` statements and provides responses accordingly.

**Conditions:**

- If your score > 80:
  - If friend's score > 80 → Go for lunch
  - If friend's score ≥ 60 → Tell friend "Good luck next time"
  - If friend's score ≥ 40 → Keep message unseen
  - If friend's score < 40 → Block your friend
- If your score ≤ 80 → Go home, sleep, and act sad

## 5. Compare Two Numbers

You have two numbers: `num1` and `num2`. A variable called `result` is used to store the output.

**Logic (using `if-else` and ternary operator):**
- If `num1 > num2` → `result = num1 * 2`
- Else → `result = num1 + num2`

## 6. Ticket Fare Calculator

Calculates ticket price based on user type.

**Conditions:**
- Children (age < 10): Free
- Students: 50% discount
- Senior citizens (age ≥ 60): 15% discount
- Others: Regular fare (800 Taka)

> **Note:** Each program demonstrates foundational programming logic using different JavaScript conditionals.
